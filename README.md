# Web-Scraping-using-Python
Web Scraping using Python Beautifulsoup

In this project I have scrapped IMBD site data to filter out Movie Name, Year, Metascore, Runtime, Votes, IMDB Rating, Director name and Genre for all the movies realeased in 2022 from Jan 1 - Dec 31. 

Cleaning:

Though most of the data were clean after scraping the columns Genre and Year had to be cleaned in order to remove redunant characters. 

To start off learning basic web scraping using python, I have experiemted with Yahoo Fiance to scrap stock data for FAANGM companies, including Company name, Stock price, Change in dollars and percent.
